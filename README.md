##Zolid-Firebase-Chat - 0.1.0
A realtime chat with private messaging and administration/moderation features. Comes with a simple profanity filter, emoticon support and more. This was my first firebase app i build for quite some time ago, so I would recommend just looking through to code (get your heart medicine ready!).
